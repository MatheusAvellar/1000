          <data>1/1000</data> to <data>1/200</data> of a second. Being
          conservative, we can assume Higgins here refers to the slowest flash
          duration, <data>1/200</data> of a second. To get to the Moon in that
          time, she'd require a speed of <mark>276,771,211,336 km/h</mark>

          To estimate a speed for Orbison in this song, we must first estabilish
          <em>where</em> he was "driving all night". The song
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Drove_All_Night">"I Drove All
          Night"</a> was written and composed by

          Kelly</a>. According to their Wikipedia pages, they both seem to have
          lived most of their lives in California, USA. According to the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_limits_in_the_United_States">
          Wikipedia article on "Speed limits in the US"</a>, the speed limit on
          an urban freeway is between <data>80–105 km/h.</data> Assuming Orbison
          was very eager to reach his destination, we can place his top speed at

          In the song, Carlton promises to walk <data>1,000 miles</data> (which

          Here, Gaye and Terrel promise that they will travel <q>as fast as [they]

          into account the very low availability of X-15's in the current aircraft

          Unlike Carlton, here Plain White T's initially considers alternatives
